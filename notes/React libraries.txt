React is a library and it's not framework.

Library - A collection of reusable tools, utilities, or functions that developers can use to perform specific tasks.
You call the library to use its tools when and how you want.

Framework - A complete, opinionated environment that provides all the tools, conventions, and structure required to build an application.
The framework calls your code as part of its lifecycle. You plug your logic into the framework.

* As react is a library we have different library for each platform. (react component will be same for each platform but it's rendering will be changed for each platform application)
* The core architecture will be same all the platform library of react.

* React Native - For Mobile Applications
* React (Core) - For Web Applications
* React 360/React VR - For Virtual Reality and 3D Applications
* React Desktop - For Desktop Applications
* React Blessed - a library that allows you to use React to build command-line (CLI) applications with blessed.

Across all these platforms, the React core (the blueprint) remains the same, and only the rendering logic changes based on the platform.
