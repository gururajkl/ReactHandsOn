Imperative: You manually write code to manipulate the DOM, specifying exactly what needs to be changed and how.
For example, you might directly use methods like document.createElement(), appendChild(), or modify DOM properties like innerHTML or style.

Declarative: You define the desired state of the UI, and a library/framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) handles the updates to the DOM for you.
You donâ€™t directly manipulate the DOM; instead, you work with abstractions like components or templates.

In React, components are essentially functions that return what you want to display in the UI. These functions describe the structure of the UI using JSX (JavaScript XML), a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML.

In React 
* Don't touch the DOM, react will do it.
* Build websites like Lego blocks.
* Unidirectional data flow, one way data flow.
* It's just UI and the rest is up to you.
